One of the latest trends in computing and the internet is that companies will make their name some common word, only
misspelled and with an x, y, or z in it (looking at you, [Xootr](http://www.xootr.com/)). This trend drives me nuts and
I'd change it if I could, but I just don't have that power. Yet.

Slightly less well known is the so-called "internet of things" which basically means that there is a new "smart" version
of everything around you which can connect to wifi or bluetooth and... do things? With a smart phone? Look, sometimes
 the functionality is tenuous, even for me. No, I shouldn't need a password for my fridge.
 
However, one of the things I _do_ like is some of the home automation functionalty: doing certain things on a schedule,
allowing other things to be done remotely via my iPhone, etc.
