For Christmas, I decided to make a nice cutting board for Shanin because, you know, who doesn't like a
cutting board? After looking around for a while, I finally found a pattern which was close to what I wanted.

Found on Pinterest, of course

The first step was choosing wood. I needed three colors or species for the fox and a fourth for the background.
Of course, the orange of padauk was my first choice for the body of the fox, and I figured that maple would
work for the white fur bits and wenge or ebony for the black. Something neutral for the background would be
good, so I thought of cherry, walnut, or oak; checking prices, I decided on wenge over ebony and cherry for the
background.

The cutting board would be made up of hundreds of small pieces of wood, each about 0.5" x 0.5" x 2.5", arranged
so the endgrain would be the face of the board. This means cutting the raw wood lengthwise into strips half an
inch square.

Once I cut the long strips, I cut them down into 2.5" pieces. It took a while, but I eventually had quite a few;
a 21 x 23 pattern means 483 pieces!

I also needed to make several 45&deg; combinations for the edges. This took some doing with such small pieces,
but eventually was able to make the wood pairings I needed. After gluing, there was trimming down to the right
sizes.

Now, it's time to assemble according to the pattern. This was fairly slow going, but I'm really happy that I had
a helper for this.

I'm even more happy because she's free labor!

After getting the layout in order, I went row by row gluing together the columns of pieces. Eventually, I have
to glue them side-to-side into rows and then glue the rows together into a whole slab. So I'd glue the pieces
and clamp them all together.

Once I got all the rows all glued, I wanted to make sure that the faces of the rows are perfectly even so the
final glue-up went well. I decided to send them through the planer. What a mistake! The planer chewed the rows
up, sending chunks flying across the garage. I'm just glad that I wasn't standing behind the planer, but rather
to the side. Luckily, the only losses were for the background pieces and I had plenty of spares!

![damage][damage]

After sanding the row faces smooth, I glued all the rows together nice and tightly. Then, when the glue dried,
I added some guides to the sides of the cutting board and sent it through the planer so it ended up nice and
smooth.

![shaped][shaped]

Some more sanding all around, corners rounding over, etc. and it was ready for a finish. Since it will be
used for food, I used food-grade mineral oil and then a mixture of mineral oil and beeswax. It made the
padauk darker than I liked, but it really highlighted the difference between the cherry and maple, so I think
it ended up looking super nice. It's also VERY smooth and kinda feels soft, even though it's also quite heavy
and solid feeling.

![final][final]

Any rate, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. The corners didn't line up quite like I wanted them to, but
it's my first cutting board, and I built it in a difficult method, so I'm not too surprised. Can't wait to see
what kind of cutting board I'll make next!
