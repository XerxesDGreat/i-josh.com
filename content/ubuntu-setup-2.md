<p>\r\n	So, when we left off in the previous installment <a href=\"http://www.i-josh.com/2014/11/19/ubuntu-setup-round-1/\">found here</a>, I had determined what the success requirement for setting up full Ubuntu-ness to my liking. Now, we're actually going to do it! Hold onto your butts!</p><h2>Get hard drive ready</h2><p>\r\n	As mentioned I was going to dual-boot Win7 and Ubuntu until I'd determined I'd gotten everything I needed. The first thing to do is to put aside some space for the installation. I've got several HDD's and an SSD; I'll want it on the SSD eventually, so might as well put it there first.</p><h3>Make room</h3><p>\r\n	If you're going to be resizing a hard drive partition (as I'd need to do), it's best to clear up some room. Unless, of course, you've already got tons of space, but I don't. So, let's do some disk cleanup!</p><ol>\r\n	\r\n<li>Hit the Start button, then type \"disk cleanup\" into the search bar. Click on the \"Disk Cleanup\" app\r\n	\r\n<p>\r\n		<img src=\"http://www.i-josh.com/uploads/Selection001.png\">\r\n	</p></li>	\r\n	\r\n<li>In this screen, select everything you feel you can clean up (I chose \"everything\" because, well, I felt I could clear it all up). This screenshot is from a clean install, but I was able to clear up about 6 GB\r\n	\r\n<p>\r\n		<img src=\"http://www.i-josh.com/uploads/Selection002.png\">\r\n	</p></li></ol><h3>Check disk for errors</h3><p>\r\	You should probably check your disk for any errors before resizing the partition. I... to be honest, I really don't know what this achieves, but it's probably a good idea to fix stuff up before moving it all around a hard drive; that way you have a better chance of fixing it properly and not losing the integrity of your drive.</p><ol>\r\n	\r\n<li>Open up Windows Explorer, right click on whichever drive you're going to shrink (C in my case), and select \"properties\"</li>	\r\n<li>Go to the \"Tools\" tab and click \"Check now...\" under \"Error checking\".</li><li>On the \"Check Disk &lt;whatever your disk is&gt;\" dialog, make sure both checkboxes are checked and hit \"Start\"</li><li><p><img src=\"http://www.i-josh.com/uploads/Selection004.png\"></p></li><li>This is going to prompt you to reboot your computer; go ahead and do it. It'll be a while booting up because it's doing all the error checking.</li></ol>
