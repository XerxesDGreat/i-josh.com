FBDescription: My first stab at inlay, I created a bookmark for a Reddit gift exchange. This was quite challenging, but
               very fun. I'm pleased (enough) with the result, though there are certainly a few changes I'll make next
               time I do a bookmark

My first inlay project, made from padouk and wenge. I had to make my own 1/16" slice of padouk and 1/8" of wenge; got
those by resawing on the table saw (not recommended! Note to self: get a band saw). Cut out the inlay pieces from padouk,
traced them onto the wenge blank, and used my Dremel tool to make a recess which was deep enough. Then glue in the
decorative piece, sand a little so the sawdust gets into the glue to fill in any gaps, clamp, and sand down once it
dries. As an added touch, I angled up the bottom surface so it's a little easier on being between book pages. Applied
some danish oil, and away we go!
