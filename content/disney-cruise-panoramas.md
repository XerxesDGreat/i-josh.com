I took a number of panoramas while we were on our Disney Cruise because sometimes a normal-sized picture just doesn't capture enough. Due to various technical difficulties and limitations, I've moved them onto a separate static page; you can find it here:  <http://www.i-josh.com/chyrp/static/pages/pano.php>. Please, feel free to enjoy them and have a look!. For a preview, here's thumbnails of the panos:
