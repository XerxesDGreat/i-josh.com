We went to Yosemite with Shanin's folks at the end of January and man, is it gorgeous there! We also had some stellar weather,
with ridiculously blue skies and not a cloud to be seen.

Of course, with such picturesque scenery, I feel I would be remiss if I didn't take tons of pictures and at least one panoramic one;
I paid for the software ([Kolor's AutoPano Pro][kolor] which, incidentally, works perfectly on Ubuntu and is pretty freaking stellar
and easy to use), so I might as well put it to use, yes?

Below, you can find my favorite few. Click on the thumbnail to get a really cool viewer ([PanoJS][panojs], about which I'll write 
another post) which you can use to zoom in and pan around. Enjoy!
