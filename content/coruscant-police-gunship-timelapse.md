Hey all, finally did another timelapse of LEGO assembly. Today's treat is the venerable Coruscant Police Gunship
(set #75046) from the Clone Wars flavor of Star Wars.

My buddies Jordan and Angela got it for me for my birthday (thanks!)
and so last night I whipped it all together. I used the same method for the timelapse as I did for
[the Tumbler][tumbler_link], and it really makes creating these things super easy! Check it out!
