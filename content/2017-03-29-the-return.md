FbDescription: i-josh.com is returning! 
Summary: In the words of Aaliyah and Timbaland, "It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you without a dope beat to step to".

I haven't posted an update since December 2015 and that's a long time. It is time to remedy that! Therefore I'm going
to start posting on a regular basis again, yaaaay!

Generally, I'm gonna be posting the same mix of stuff, filling in some of what has gone on in the 15 month gap, and then
posting updates on my projects.

Sounds like fun, right? I'm stoked! Can't wait to get the next post up. See you then!
