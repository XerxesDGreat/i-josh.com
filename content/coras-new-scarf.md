FBDescription: I made a nice, soft scarf for Cora in her favorite color. I made a couple mistakes with the pattern, but
               I don't think Cora likes it any less.

Because there's only so many things I can make for myself, and because I am enjoying knitting on the train (except for
the nasty knot I get between my left shoulder blade and my spine), I decided to make Cora a scarf.

We went to Michael's and I let her pick out the yarn; this one is... red. And very soft. And... bulky weight? I forgot
to write the details of the yarn down. Any rate, red is Cora's favorite color (and she picked it out), so it works.

When it came to the design, I decided that ribbing is boring (rather, it's basic), and I didn't want to do a Stockinette
stitch due to the wicked curl, so I was looking around for stitches. I decided I liked the look of the Double Moss
stitch, which is kinda like a larger Seed stitch. Essentially, it's alternating pairs of rows. You k1-p1 on the
 right side, then turn it over and k1-p1 the next row (wrong side). Then, rows 3 and 4, you p1-k1 (right side row 3,
 wrong side row 4). Wash, rinse, repeat.
 
Now, I might say that, unless you're concentrating, it's easy to lose track of which row you're on (I knit while
listening to interesting audio books or podcasts, so that's where most of my concentration goes), and with yarn like
this (super fluffy), it's pretty hard to see what you did on the last row. Soooo, there are some spots on the scarf
where I inadvertently did ribbing because I did another row 1-2 (or 3-4) pattern after already having done those rows.
Oops.

Any rate, Cora loves the scarf, and that's all that matters, right?
