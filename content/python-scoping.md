Title: Python Scoping

See, Python has a fun interpretation of scoping. Let's say I define a variable and a function at the same level, then
access the variable from the function; the function will read the variable just fine. This is because Python looks for
the variable in the current scope, then bumps up a scope level, looks again, etc. until it finds it or runs out of scope.

    :::Python
    my_var = 'abcd'
    
    def my_func():
        print my_var
        
    my_func()
    > "abcd"
    
However, things change when you write to the variable. At that point, if the variable doesn't already exist in this
scope, Python will create it, regardless of whether it's in a different scope. Again, this is all logical, but it looks
a little weird.

    :::Python
    my_var = 'abcd'
    
    def my_func():
        print my_var
        my_var = 'defg'
        print my_var
    
    my_func()
    > "abcd"
    > "defg"
    
    print my_var
    > "abcd"
