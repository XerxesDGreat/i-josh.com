FBDescription: Announcing new layout for the site.

Hey all, in lieu of finishing the field encapsulation series, I thought I'd bring you
this announcement: I made my site prettier! Woo! Please take a look around and tell me what you think!

I based this on a couple sources. The main structure and many of the accoutrements are based on [KenMercusLai's 
theme BT3-Flat][bt3flat] and the color scheme came from [Templated.co's theme Mongoose][mongoose]. The pictures
on the main page are all ones I took; I'll be changing them up from time to time as I go through old
images or take new ones I like.

It took me a while to get everything right, and I'm still not done. I want to tweak the archives sidebar, and I
also want to add a comment system (possibly Facebook-driven, possibly Disqus-driven), and those changes will be
rolling out soon.

Any rate, on Thursday, I'll finish up the field encapsulation series; just wanted to draw attention to the
new layout!
