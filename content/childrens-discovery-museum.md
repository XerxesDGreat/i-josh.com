FBDescription: Cora and I went on an outing to the Children's Discovery Museum to while away a rainy day


What's the best thing to do on a rainy day? Okay, what's the next best thing on a rainy day, besides "stay at home and
drink hot cocoa, curled up on the couch, binge watching whatever thing is hot on Netflix right now"?

That's right, indoor outing! Cora and I took off to go have some fun at the Children's Discovery Museum while Shanin was
out of town. But boy, was it busy! Everyone else had the same idea. That didn't stop us from having a good time though!

To add to the adventure of it, we took the VTA into downtown rather than driving. Cora, of course, spent the time
waiting for the train playing in the rain (I was looking for Spain or plains, but couldn't see any, though we did hear
planes).

While there, the first thing we did was go to the fire truck. Of course, since it's right in the entry way (and because,
c'mon, it's a fire truck), everyone else did to, so that was more frustrating than anything else. So, we went to the 
ambulance because hey, it's an ambulance!

We also played with different types of building materials (no LEGO, sadly), and with the other people ALSO playing with
said building materials.

We saw a play about water with Potter the Otter (boy otter played by a girl... why they couldn't use the boy as the
otter or make the otter a girl, I don't know), and Cora volunteered herself for the last volunteer bit. They asked for
volunteers and chose a girl right next to her to come on stage, but that girl had already been up, so they chose a boy
from elsewhere in the audience. Poor Cora misunderstood and went up there anyway. Then, before they did the bow, she
wasn't listnening and jetted over to sit back down and did the bow elsewhere. I got a giggle out of it.

And we finally ended up... in the water zone, where she got more wet than while she was playing in the actual rain.

All in all, we had a really good time. Can't wait till we go on our next excursion!
